## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This notebook presents a streamlined machine-learning workflow for wildfire detection and intensity estimation using theâ€¯VIIRS satellite dataset for Sweden in 2018. It begins with loading and exploring the dataâ€”including key features like brightness temperatures (bright_ti4, bright_ti5) and fire radiative power (frp)â€”then filters and prepares a clean dataset for regression modeling. The code sets up a feature matrix and target variable (frp), providing the foundation for training regression models (such as RandomForest or Linear Regression) to predict fire intensity from satellite-derived spectral measurements. It is written with maintainability and performance in mind, leveraging libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and joblib for clear structure, efficient computation, and easy extension to full model training and evaluation.

This project implements a machine learning pipeline designed to classify input data using Python. Key components include:

- **Data loading and preprocessing**  
- **Feature engineering**  
- **Model training and evaluation**  
- **Performance logging and result visualization**

The pipeline is modular and can be easily adapted to new datasets or models.
